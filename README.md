Bioinformatics is a multidisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data. It involves the application of computational methods and algorithms to understand biological processes, organize and analyze large-scale biological datasets, and gain insights into complex biological systems.

Bioinformatics plays a crucial role in various areas of biological research, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and evolutionary biology. By integrating and analyzing vast amounts of biological data, such as DNA and protein sequences, gene expression profiles, and protein structures, bioinformatics helps researchers extract meaningful information and make biological discoveries.

Some specific areas of bioinformatics include:

1. Sequence Analysis: Analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences to identify patterns, motifs, and similarities. This includes tasks such as sequence alignment, gene prediction, and annotation.

2. Structural Bioinformatics: Predicting and analyzing the three-dimensional structures of proteins and other biomolecules. This involves methods like protein modeling, structure prediction, and molecular docking.

3. Genomics: Studying the structure, function, and evolution of genomes, including genome assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics.

4. Transcriptomics: Analyzing gene expression patterns using techniques like microarrays and RNA sequencing to understand how genes are regulated and how they contribute to specific biological processes.

5. Proteomics: Studying the structure, function, and interactions of proteins within a cell or organism. This includes protein identification, quantification, and characterization.

6. Systems Biology: Integrating biological data from multiple sources to model and understand complex biological systems and their behavior.

7. Data Mining and Machine Learning: Developing algorithms and statistical models to extract knowledge and patterns from large biological datasets.

Bioinformatics tools and databases are essential for researchers in these areas to store, retrieve, and analyze biological data. They also contribute to advancements in fields such as drug discovery, personalized medicine, and agricultural biotechnology by aiding in the identification of potential drug targets, understanding disease mechanisms, and improving crop productivity.

First of all, I run all my R-projects on PyCharm Community which has installed the R-program in my operating system and its plugin in PyCharm. Therefore, you should install R on your system and also R's IDE.
